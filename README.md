This repository's goal is to compare and contrast various machine learning models (both supervised and unsupervised).
Each file is a careful analysis of a specific model.
For each model, I analyzed the effects of various hyperparemeters (learning rate, momentum, e.t.c.)
And, for each model, I used online data sets to determine how effective the model reallt is.
